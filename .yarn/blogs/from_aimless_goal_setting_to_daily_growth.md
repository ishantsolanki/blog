# From Aimless Goal-Setting to Daily Growth: My Journey to Meaning

## Introduction: The Pressure to Have It All Figured Out

We are often told that life must have a purpose.  
That we need a clear goal.  
That we should work relentlessly toward it.

Books, mentors, podcasts — they all echo the same message: *set a goal and chase it*. I tried to do exactly that. I searched for a purpose. I tried to define a goal that would give my life direction and meaning.

But I never could.

Not because I didn’t care — but because every goal I came up with felt wrong.

## Why Traditional Goals Didn’t Work for Me

When it came to setting goals, I faced a constant internal conflict.

If the goal was **too ambitious**, it felt unrealistic. And if it was unrealistic, hope disappeared before I even started. A goal without hope is worthless.

If the goal was **too small**, it felt uninspiring — something I could reach without real growth.

And then there was the biggest fear of all:  
**What happens after I achieve the goal?**

Would I be left with emptiness again?  
Would I need to scramble for the *next* goal just to feel alive?

That thought alone made the whole idea of goal-setting feel fragile.

## The Problem With Time-Boxed Goals

Another thing that never sat right with me was timeboxing.

“In five years, I’ll become X.”  
“In ten years, I’ll achieve Y.”

But what if it only takes two years?  
Or what if it takes eight?

Life isn’t predictable. Timelines assume control over variables we don’t actually control. Attaching meaning to an arbitrary deadline felt like setting myself up for disappointment — either by being “too slow” or by finishing early and feeling lost again.

I didn’t want my happiness to depend on a calendar.

## The Aha Moment: 1% Better Every Day

The shift happened unexpectedly.

While preparing for an interview with DoorDash, I came across one of their core values:  
**“1% better every day.”**

Something clicked instantly.

What if, instead of chasing a distant end goal, I simply focused on improving a little — every single day?

No finish line.  
No deadline.  
No fear of “what’s next.”

Just progress.

## Redefining Growth Without an End Goal

This idea changed how I think about improvement.

Being 1% better doesn’t mean hustling endlessly. It doesn’t mean perfection. It means **looking for opportunities to improve**, wherever life already is.

That improvement might show up in:
- Parenting  
- Programming  
- Playing chess  
- Listening more patiently  
- Responding instead of reacting  

Some days, the 1% is tiny. Other days, it’s invisible. But over time, it compounds.

And unlike traditional goals, this approach never expires.

## Living in the Present Instead of Waiting for the Dream

One of the biggest realizations was this:

**Why wait for life to become meaningful in the future?**

What if the present moment is already the dream?

So I started living differently.

I play with my daughter like a child — fully present.  
I talk to my parents with genuine gratitude for what they’ve done for me.  
I stopped postponing joy for some imagined version of success.

Purpose didn’t come from achieving something.  
It came from *how* I lived each day.

## What “1% Better” Looks Like in Real Life

This philosophy isn’t rigid. It’s flexible and human.

Some days, being 1% better means learning something new.  
Some days, it means resting when I need to.  
Some days, it means admitting I was wrong.

The goal isn’t optimization — it’s awareness.

By staying curious and reflective, growth becomes a natural byproduct of living.

## Why Journaling Became My First Step

Writing this blog is not an announcement.  
It’s an action.

Journaling my life is one of the most powerful ways I’ve found to grow consistently. It allows me to:
- Reflect on experiences  
- Retain lessons over time  
- Notice patterns in my thoughts and behavior  
- Track progress without pressure  

By looking back, I can move forward more intentionally.

And by sharing my perspective, I’m not just documenting my journey — I’m learning from it.

## Finding Meaning Without a Finish Line

I no longer believe that purpose is something you *find* once and hold onto forever.

Purpose can be practiced.

It’s in the small moments.  
The daily choices.  
The decision to be slightly better today than yesterday.

There is no emptiness at the end — because there is no end.

## Conclusion: Progress Over Perfection

I stopped chasing big goals not because ambition is bad — but because growth doesn’t need a deadline.

Striving to be **1% better every day** gave me something more sustainable than any grand plan:  
a way to live fully, right now.

This blog is just the beginning.  
A record of progress.  
A commitment to reflection.  
A reminder that becoming better doesn’t require knowing exactly where you’re going — only that you keep moving.
