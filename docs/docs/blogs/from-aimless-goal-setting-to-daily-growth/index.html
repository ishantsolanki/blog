  <div class="post-content"><h2>Introduction: The Pressure to Have It All Figured Out</h2>
<p>We are often told that life must have a purpose.<br>
That we need a clear goal.<br>
That we should work relentlessly toward it.</p>
<p>Books, mentors, podcasts — they all echo the same message: <em>set a goal and chase it</em>. I tried to do exactly that. I searched for a purpose. I tried to define a goal that would give my life direction and meaning.</p>
<p>But I never could.</p>
<p>Not because I didn't care — but because every goal I came up with felt wrong.</p>
<h2>Why Traditional Goals Didn't Work for Me</h2>
<p>When it came to setting goals, I faced a constant internal conflict.</p>
<p>If the goal was <strong>too ambitious</strong>, it felt unrealistic. And if it was unrealistic, hope disappeared before I even started. A goal without hope is worthless.</p>
<p>If the goal was <strong>too small</strong>, it felt uninspiring — something I could reach without real growth.</p>
<p>And then there was the biggest fear of all:<br>
<strong>What happens after I achieve the goal?</strong></p>
<p>Would I be left with emptiness again?<br>
Would I need to scramble for the <em>next</em> goal just to feel alive?</p>
<p>That thought alone made the whole idea of goal-setting feel fragile.</p>
<h2>The Problem With Time-Boxed Goals</h2>
<p>Another thing that never sat right with me was timeboxing.</p>
<p>&quot;In five years, I'll become X.&quot;<br>
&quot;In ten years, I'll achieve Y.&quot;</p>
<p>But what if it only takes two years?<br>
Or what if it takes eight?</p>
<p>Life isn't predictable. Timelines assume control over variables we don't actually control. Attaching meaning to an arbitrary deadline felt like setting myself up for disappointment — either by being &quot;too slow&quot; or by finishing early and feeling lost again.</p>
<p>I didn't want my happiness to depend on a calendar.</p>
<h2>The Aha Moment: 1% Better Every Day</h2>
<p>The shift happened unexpectedly.</p>
<p>While preparing for an interview with DoorDash, I came across one of their core values:<br>
<strong>&quot;1% better every day.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Something clicked instantly.</p>
<p>What if, instead of chasing a distant end goal, I simply focused on improving a little — every single day?</p>
<p>No finish line.<br>
No deadline.<br>
No fear of &quot;what's next.&quot;</p>
<p>Just progress.</p>
<h2>Redefining Growth Without an End Goal</h2>
<p>This idea changed how I think about improvement.</p>
<p>Being 1% better doesn't mean hustling endlessly. It doesn't mean perfection. It means <strong>looking for opportunities to improve</strong>, wherever life already is.</p>
<p>That improvement might show up in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parenting</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Playing chess</li>
<li>Listening more patiently</li>
<li>Responding instead of reacting</li>
</ul>
<p>Some days, the 1% is tiny. Other days, it's invisible. But over time, it compounds.</p>
<p>And unlike traditional goals, this approach never expires.</p>
<h2>Living in the Present Instead of Waiting for the Dream</h2>
<p>One of the biggest realizations was this:</p>
<p><strong>Why wait for life to become meaningful in the future?</strong></p>
<p>What if the present moment is already the dream?</p>
<p>So I started living differently.</p>
<p>I play with my daughter like a child — fully present.<br>
I talk to my parents with genuine gratitude for what they've done for me.<br>
I stopped postponing joy for some imagined version of success.</p>
<p>Purpose didn't come from achieving something.<br>
It came from <em>how</em> I lived each day.</p>
<h2>What &quot;1% Better&quot; Looks Like in Real Life</h2>
<p>This philosophy isn't rigid. It's flexible and human.</p>
<p>Some days, being 1% better means learning something new.<br>
Some days, it means resting when I need to.<br>
Some days, it means admitting I was wrong.</p>
<p>The goal isn't optimization — it's awareness.</p>
<p>By staying curious and reflective, growth becomes a natural byproduct of living.</p>
<h2>Why Journaling Became My First Step</h2>
<p>Writing this blog is not an announcement.<br>
It's an action.</p>
<p>Journaling my life is one of the most powerful ways I've found to grow consistently. It allows me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on experiences</li>
<li>Retain lessons over time</li>
<li>Notice patterns in my thoughts and behavior</li>
<li>Track progress without pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>By looking back, I can move forward more intentionally.</p>
<p>And by sharing my perspective, I'm not just documenting my journey — I'm learning from it.</p>
<h2>Finding Meaning Without a Finish Line</h2>
<p>I no longer believe that purpose is something you <em>find</em> once and hold onto forever.</p>
<p>Purpose can be practiced.</p>
<p>It's in the small moments.<br>
The daily choices.<br>
The decision to be slightly better today than yesterday.</p>
<p>There is no emptiness at the end — because there is no end.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Progress Over Perfection</h2>
<p>I stopped chasing big goals not because ambition is bad — but because growth doesn't need a deadline.</p>
<p>Striving to be <strong>1% better every day</strong> gave me something more sustainable than any grand plan:<br>
a way to live fully, right now.</p>
<p>This blog is just the beginning.<br>
A record of progress.<br>
A commitment to reflection.<br>
A reminder that becoming better doesn't require knowing exactly where you're going — only that you keep moving.</p>
